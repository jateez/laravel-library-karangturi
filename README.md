## About Lib-Karangturi

Lib-Karangturi was a project that I built during the Mahasiswa Mengabdi 1000 Desa program. It is a app designed to be used for publishing informations regarding Karangturi village's Library Community. Built in Laravel, Blade, and Bootstrap 5. Not the best thing that I made, but the best thing at what I can do during that time.
